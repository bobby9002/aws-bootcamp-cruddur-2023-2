# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Week 0 -Homework / Tasks - Required

### INSTALLING AWS CLI

Managed to do it on Gitpod ,but when i try to reopen Gitpod after sometime i need to manually install AwsCli again.
So i also installed the AwsCli on my windows-10 ,in order to prove that i am able to use the AwsCli.

Steps taken to Install AWS CLI on Windows-10
- Follewed the Aws Documentation to install Aws Cli on windows.
[AWS DOCUMENTATION LINK FOR WINDOWS ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

```
msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi
```
I have entered the above command in Command Prompt to install the Aws Cli.
once installed ,to confirm it is installed ,i have checked with the commands aws, aws --version at the command prompt.
